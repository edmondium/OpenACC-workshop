# Task 5: Data Region

Instead of using individual data copies per parallel region, we want to make the data reside on the GPU device for the whole runtime of the program. Please implement the according statement as an annotation to the `while` loop.

Compile the program with `make`, submit it to the batch system with `make run`.
